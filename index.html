              If you play video games, you have most likely come across some
              requiring you to fight or shoot people - and you were not being
              the good guy defending the poor and innocent! You will also have
              heard that there is a lot more violence today than before. It is
              no wonder then that some people are quick to make the relationship
              between violence in video games - and in media in general - and
              the increase of violence in real life.

              Collaboration with peers and your teacher will be essential to the
              task. Class time will be allocated to this task but group
              collaboration will be necessary out of class also. Each group
              should arrange times appropriate for their members.
